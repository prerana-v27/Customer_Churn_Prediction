# Customer_Churn_Prediction
Overview
This project is a Customer Churn Prediction App built using Python and Streamlit. It leverages machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various input parameters such as age, tenure, and monthly charges.

## Features
âœ… User-friendly Streamlit UI

âœ… Machine learning model trained on customer data

âœ… Uses Pandas for data handling and preprocessing

âœ… Matplotlib for visualizing data insights

âœ… Joblib for saving and loading ML models

âœ… Real-time churn prediction

## Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit

Libraries Used:

Pandas â€“ Data handling and preprocessing

Matplotlib â€“ Data visualization

Joblib â€“ Model serialization

Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning model training


## Model Training
The dataset is preprocessed using Pandas.

A machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn.

The trained model is saved using Joblib for faster inference.

### Conclusion 
The Customer Churn Prediction project applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict churn likelihood. Using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Joblib, the model processes key customer attributes to generate predictions. Built with Streamlit, the application provides an interactive interface for easy input and visualization.  

While the project is currently in the development phase, it can be further enhanced by improving model accuracy, integrating more features, and eventually deploying it for real-world use. ðŸš€
