# Customer_Churn_Prediction
Overview
This project is a Customer Churn Prediction App built using Python and Streamlit. It leverages machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various input parameters such as age, tenure, and monthly charges.

## Features
✅ User-friendly Streamlit UI
✅ Machine learning model trained on customer data
✅ Uses Pandas for data handling and preprocessing
✅ Matplotlib for visualizing data insights
✅ Joblib for saving and loading ML models
✅ Real-time churn prediction

## Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit

Libraries Used:

Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Joblib – Model serialization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning model training


## Model Training
The dataset is preprocessed using Pandas.

A machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn.

The trained model is saved using Joblib for faster inference.
